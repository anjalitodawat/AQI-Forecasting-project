# 🌫️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of India's Air Quality Index (AQI)

## 🧠 Overview
This project explores India's Air Quality Index (AQI) data through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify pollution trends, visualize patterns, and extract actionable insights.

## 📊 Dataset
The data used in this analysis is publicly available from the **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)** — the official environmental authority of the Government of India ([cpcb.nic.in](https://cpcb.nic.in/)).
The dataset has been sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india), which compiles daily air quality records collected across multiple Indian cities.

## ⚡ EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding any dataset.  
It helps uncover trends and patterns, identify key features, and reveal which pollutants contribute most to the Air Quality Index (AQI) in different regions.  
By performing EDA, we gain actionable insights that guide further analysis and decision-making.
